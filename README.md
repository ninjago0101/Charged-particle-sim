# Charged-particle-sim

This project simulates the motion of a charged particle in electric and magnetic fields. It uses the Lorentz force equation:
 F = qE + qv Ã— B
to calculate the particle's acceleration and trajectory.

Run:
Install Python 3 and Matplotlib: pip install matplotlib.
DL the code. 
Run the script in a terminal.
enter the particle's charge, mass, position, velocity, and fields when prompted.
